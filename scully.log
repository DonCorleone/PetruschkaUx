 Deprecation Notice:
       ======================================================================
         From now on, the plugin that is being used to render a route is
         able to be changed by the user. You can do this by adding or
         enabling the plugin your scully.kinderkulturUx.config.ts
         file. For your convenience, we loaded the Puppeteer plugin for you.

         To disable this warning enable the plugin of your choice.
         for Puppeteer please add:
             import '@scullyio/scully-plugin-puppeteer';
          to your scully.kinderkulturUx.config.ts file.

          When you get this warning while not using scully-plugin-puppeteer
          you need to set the defaultRouteRenderer to the name of your plugin.
          The defaultRouteRenderer is now set to 'routeRenderer'.
